## 💡 Game Development Philosophy

> *"Games aren't just mechanics – they're worlds where players live, breathe, and feel."*

My approach to game development:

- 🎭 **Story First**: Every system serves the narrative
- 🌍 **World Building**: Details create immersion
- 🎮 **Meaningful Interaction**: Every button press should matter
- 💔 **Emotional Impact**: Games should touch the heart
- 🔧 **Technical Excellence**: Polish separates good from great
- 🎯 **Player Agency**: Let players shape their journey

**Inspired by:**
- Red Dead Redemption 2's attention to detail
- The Last of Us's emotional storytelling
- Ghost of Tsushima's environmental design
- God of War's character development
